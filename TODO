ROADMAP
=================

Before 1.6:

- for server side ragdoll spawns, just stay at point of death

- fix all crashes (video mode change, change server)
- mech crush hachy/kami w/out landing on them (Dot prod at touch: fwd x dir, must be on ground)

- credits button

- spacewreck improvements (more eggs) (bottom hallways higher/wider)
- geofusion (more eggs)
- new museum map



Future fixes:
