ROADMAP
=================

Shotgun thoughts: alt-fire = toggle ammo type
-- switch = load what's possible from dest type
-- empty = auto load other type
-- switch to weapon on empty = auto load available type

CODE:
-- why only 2 flares!?
- hatchy can grapple and get stuck in ceilings...
- shotgun empty/holster/ammo-change glitchy
- move damage tables to resource file
- end game music/screen
- c4 priming is glitchy when you change weapons
- make other weapons more obvious
- Engy: combine-light entity?  entity direction... like TF-2?
- fix breeder destroy usage to be more obvious (how to other organisms eat?)

FX:
- improve framerate for smoke gren and acid grens
- death sounds ++

MODELS:
- import new gasser high poly, make UV maps/texture
- make low-poly versions of gasser and LOD them
- gore ++++
- more custom gibs

MAPS:
- building 5...
- work on museum hybrid/building 5?
- drone can't fit in medical bay vent.. make bigger
- geofusion (more eggs, mods by Garuga)
- spacewreck: vent in reactor room occluded by bottom door
- spacewreck: fire room not updated! d'oh
- spacewreck: stinger stuck on top left egg in reactor (looking in from front)


Future fixes:

- auto-kick/voting system

- guardian spike ball = more like trap on ground?

- medic w/flare
- wraith
- credits button
- acid/smoke grenade lag
