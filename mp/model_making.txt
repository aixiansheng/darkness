game dir should have:

models/modelname/x.mdl, x*.vtx, x.phy, x.vvd
materials/models/modelname.*.vtf (referenced by model)


make a Valve Texture Format (.vtf) from a tga:
	- make X.tga
	- make X.vtf with Vtex/VTFEdit
	- put X.vtf in materials/models/

make a Valve Material Type (.vmt):
	- make Y.vmt
	- put Y.vmt in materials/models/Lw
	- something like this:
	"VertexLitGeneric"
	{
		"$basetexture" "models/X/Y"
		"$model" 1
	}
	- "$cdmaterials" is relative to materials/models

- export a model as an .smd
- make a QC file:
	- use spaces, not tabs
	- each vertex group looks like:
	triangles
	foo.tga or foo (material names)
	...
	...
	...

- compile with studiomdl -game C:\\... some dir with a models dir


===============
why can't it find the texture!?
hitbox vs phys? scale wrong?

==== PHYSICS/COLLISION MODELS ===

- join conves/simple brushes (ctrl-j)
- one bone parent per convex body works best (massive weight painting helps)


==== calcblend errors can occur if the bone mentioned isn't attached to a parent directly? (arm.R on mech vs spine, which works)
